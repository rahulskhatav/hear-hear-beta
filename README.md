**Hear, Hear** is an online debating web application with a *Django* backend. The application is connected
to *SQLite* database which provides security and accuracy to the data. Online text-based debating
over group messengers becomes messy and extremely hard to follow. Hear, Hear helps organize content
and make debates more interactive. Now users can sign up and create motions, post arguments and
rebuttals.
